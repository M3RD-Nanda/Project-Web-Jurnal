# Solana RPC Error 403 Fix

## Problem

The application was experiencing `Error 403: Access forbidden` when trying to fetch Solana wallet balances. This error occurred because the application was using the default Solana RPC endpoints which have strict rate limiting.

## Root Cause

- The original implementation used `clusterApiUrl()` from `@solana/web3.js` which points to public RPC endpoints
- These endpoints have very strict rate limits and frequently return 403 errors
- No retry mechanism or fallback endpoints were implemented

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced RPC Endpoint Configuration

- **File**: `src/lib/solana-config.ts`
- Added support for multiple reliable RPC endpoints with fallback support
- Implemented environment variable support for custom RPC endpoints
- Added endpoints from reliable providers like Alchemy, Ankr, and others

### 2. Connection Management with Fallback

- **File**: `src/lib/solana-connection.ts`
- Created utility functions for connection management
- Implemented automatic fallback to alternative endpoints
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff
- Connection pooling for better performance

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling

- **File**: `src/hooks/useSolanaSafe.ts`
- Improved error handling with user-friendly messages
- Integrated with the new fallback connection system
- Better retry logic for rate-limited requests

### 4. Provider Configuration Update

- **File**: `src/components/SolanaProvider.tsx`
- Updated to use the new reliable endpoint configuration
- Removed dependency on the problematic `clusterApiUrl()`

## Configuration Options

### Environment Variables

You can now configure custom RPC endpoints via environment variables:

```env
# Custom RPC endpoints (optional)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_MAINNET_RPC=https://your-custom-mainnet-rpc.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_DEVNET_RPC=https://api.devnet.solana.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_TESTNET_RPC=https://api.testnet.solana.com
```

### Default Reliable Endpoints

If no custom endpoints are provided, the application uses these reliable endpoints in order:

1. **Syndica** (with API key): `https://solana-mainnet.api.syndica.io/api-key/[API_KEY]`
2. **Alchemy** (free tier): `https://solana-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/demo`
3. **Ankr** (free tier): `https://rpc.ankr.com/solana`
4. **Official Solana**: `https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com`

**Note**: The application is now configured with a Syndica API key for optimal performance and reliability.

## Features Added

### Automatic Fallback

- If one endpoint fails, automatically tries the next available endpoint
- Seamless user experience without manual intervention

### Retry Logic

- Exponential backoff for temporary failures
- Smart retry for rate-limited requests
- Maximum retry limits to prevent infinite loops

### Better Error Messages

- User-friendly error messages instead of technical errors
- Specific guidance for different types of failures
- Clear indication when rate limits are hit

### Connection Pooling

- Reuses connections for better performance
- Reduces overhead of creating new connections
- Automatic cleanup of stale connections

## Recommended RPC Providers

The application is currently configured with Syndica API for optimal performance. For additional or alternative providers:

1. **Syndica** (currently configured): https://syndica.io/
2. **Alchemy**: https://www.alchemy.com/solana
3. **QuickNode**: https://www.quicknode.com/chains/sol
4. **Helius**: https://www.helius.dev/
5. **Ankr**: https://www.ankr.com/rpc/solana/

## Testing

The fix has been tested with:

- ✅ Syndica API connectivity (Health check: OK, Version: 2.2.16)
- ✅ Multiple wallet connections
- ✅ Balance fetching without rate limit errors
- ✅ Network switching between mainnet/devnet
- ✅ Error scenarios and recovery
- ✅ Fallback endpoint functionality

### Test Results

- **Syndica API Health**: ✅ OK
- **Solana Core Version**: 2.2.16
- **Feature Set**: 3073396398
- **Error 403 Resolution**: ✅ Resolved

## Future Improvements

- Implement endpoint health monitoring
- Add metrics for endpoint performance
- Automatic endpoint rotation based on performance
- Circuit breaker pattern for failed endpoints
