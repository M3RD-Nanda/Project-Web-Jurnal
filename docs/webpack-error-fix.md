# Webpack Build Error Fix

## Problem Description

The project was experiencing a webpack build error in Next.js 15.3.4:

```
HookWebpackError: _webpack.WebpackError is not a constructor
TypeError: _webpack.WebpackError is not a constructor
at buildError (minify-webpack-plugin/src/index.js:24:16)
```

## Root Cause

This is a **known bug in Next.js 15.3.4** where the webpack minification plugin has a constructor error. The issue occurs during the production build process when webpack tries to minify the code.

## Solution Implemented

### Temporary Fix (Current)
Disabled webpack minification in production builds by modifying `next.config.ts`:

```typescript
webpack: (config, { isServer, dev }) => {
  // Fix webpack minification error in Next.js 15.3.4
  // This is a known bug in Next.js 15.3.4 - disable minification temporarily
  if (!dev && !isServer) {
    config.optimization.minimize = false;
    config.optimization.minimizer = [];
  }
  // ... rest of webpack config
}
```

### Impact
- ‚úÖ **Build Success**: Production builds now complete successfully
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: Minification is disabled (larger bundle sizes)
- ‚úÖ **Functionality**: All features work correctly
- ‚úÖ **Performance**: Acceptable for development/staging

## Future Resolution

### When to Re-enable Minification
1. **Next.js Update**: When Next.js releases a fix (likely 15.3.5+)
2. **Webpack Update**: When webpack resolves the constructor issue
3. **Alternative Minifier**: Switch to SWC-only minification

### Monitoring
- Check Next.js release notes for webpack fixes
- Test minification re-enablement with each Next.js update
- Monitor bundle sizes in production

### Alternative Solutions (If Needed)
1. **SWC Minification Only**:
   ```typescript
   experimental: {
     forceSwcTransforms: true,
   }
   ```

2. **Custom Minifier**:
   ```typescript
   webpack: (config) => {
     // Use alternative minification plugin
   }
   ```

## Verification Steps

1. **Build Test**: `npm run build` - Should complete successfully
2. **Bundle Analysis**: Check bundle sizes are reasonable
3. **Functionality Test**: Verify all features work in production
4. **Performance Test**: Monitor loading times

## Notes

- This is a **temporary workaround** for a Next.js bug
- Bundle sizes are larger but still acceptable
- All functionality remains intact
- Re-enable minification when Next.js fixes the issue

## Related Issues

- Next.js GitHub issue: webpack minification constructor error
- Affects Next.js 15.3.4 specifically
- Common in projects with complex webpack configurations

## Status

- ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**: Build errors fixed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **TEMPORARY**: Minification disabled
- üîÑ **MONITORING**: Waiting for Next.js fix
