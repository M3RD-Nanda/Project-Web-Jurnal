# React Hooks Order Fix Documentation

## üéØ Problem Description

**Error**: React Hook Order Violation in UnifiedWalletButton
```
Error: React has detected a change in the order of Hooks called by UnifiedWalletButton. 
This will lead to bugs and errors if not fixed. 
For more information, read the Rules of Hooks: https://react.dev/link/rules-of-hooks

Previous render            Next render
------------------------------------------------------
1. useState                   useState
2. useState                   useState
...
65. useEffect                 useEffect
66. undefined                 useEffect
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

**Root Cause**: Early return statement (`if (!mounted)`) was placed in the middle of the component after some hooks had been called, but before other hooks (useEffect, useCallback) were called. This violates the Rules of Hooks which require all hooks to be called in the same order on every render.

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### **Hook Order Violation Fix**
**File**: `src/components/wallet/UnifiedWalletButton.tsx`

**Problem**: Early return was interrupting the hook call sequence:
```tsx
// ‚ùå WRONG: Early return after some hooks but before others
export function UnifiedWalletButton() {
  const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false);
  // ... other hooks
  const evmWallets = useEvmWallets();
  const { isConnected } = useAccountSafe();
  // ... more hooks
  
  useEffect(() => {
    setMounted(true);
  }, []);

  // ‚ùå EARLY RETURN HERE - VIOLATES RULES OF HOOKS
  if (!mounted) {
    return <Button>Loading...</Button>;
  }

  // ‚ùå These hooks come AFTER the early return
  useEffect(() => { /* ... */ }, []);
  const handleClose = useCallback(() => { /* ... */ }, []);
  
  return <div>...</div>;
}
```

**Solution**: Moved early return to after ALL hooks have been called:
```tsx
// ‚úÖ CORRECT: All hooks called before any conditional returns
export function UnifiedWalletButton() {
  const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false);
  // ... other hooks
  const evmWallets = useEvmWallets();
  const { isConnected } = useAccountSafe();
  // ... more hooks
  
  useEffect(() => {
    setMounted(true);
  }, []);

  // ‚úÖ ALL other hooks called here
  useEffect(() => { /* ... */ }, []);
  const handleClose = useCallback(() => { /* ... */ }, []);

  // ‚úÖ Early return AFTER all hooks
  if (!mounted) {
    return <Button>Loading...</Button>;
  }
  
  return <div>...</div>;
}
```

## üîß Technical Details

### Rules of Hooks Violation

The Rules of Hooks state:
1. **Only call hooks at the top level** - Don't call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions
2. **Always call hooks in the same order** - Don't call hooks after early returns, conditions, or loops

### Hook Sequence in UnifiedWalletButton

**All hooks that must be called in order**:
1. `useState` hooks (lines 53-60)
2. `useWalletErrorHandler()` (line 63)
3. `useEvmWallets()` (line 66)
4. `useAccountSafe()`, `useChainIdSafe()`, `useDisconnectSafe()`, `useConnectSafe()` (lines 69-72)
5. `useWalletSafe()` (line 84)
6. `useEffect()` hooks (lines 90, 95, 102, 110)
7. `useCallback()` hooks (lines 161, 171)

**The Fix**: Moved the early return from line 95 to line 178 (after all hooks).

### Why This Matters

When React re-renders a component, it expects hooks to be called in the exact same order every time. If an early return prevents some hooks from being called, React gets confused about which hook corresponds to which state/effect, leading to:
- State corruption
- Effect cleanup issues
- Memory leaks
- Unpredictable behavior

## üöÄ Results

### Before Fix
```
‚ùå React Hook Order Violation error
‚ùå Console errors during development
‚ùå Potential state corruption
‚ùå Unpredictable component behavior
‚ùå Failed component renders
```

### After Fix
```
‚úÖ No hook order violations
‚úÖ Clean console during development
‚úÖ Consistent hook execution order
‚úÖ Reliable component behavior
‚úÖ Proper state management
```

## üìä Verification

### Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
# ‚úÖ Server starts successfully on port 3001
# ‚úÖ No React Hook Order errors
# ‚úÖ No console warnings
# ‚úÖ Component renders correctly
```

### Component Behavior
- **Loading State**: Shows properly during mount
- **Hook Execution**: All hooks called in consistent order
- **State Management**: No state corruption
- **Re-renders**: Consistent behavior across renders

## üîç Key Learnings

1. **Hook Order is Critical**: React relies on consistent hook call order for state management
2. **Early Returns are Dangerous**: Never place early returns between hook calls
3. **All Hooks First**: Call all hooks before any conditional logic or returns
4. **Component Structure**: Structure components with hooks at the top, logic in the middle, render at the bottom
5. **Development Testing**: Hook violations often only appear during development with React's strict mode

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

### Component Structure Pattern
```tsx
function MyComponent() {
  // 1. ALL HOOKS FIRST (no exceptions)
  const [state1, setState1] = useState();
  const [state2, setState2] = useState();
  const customHook = useCustomHook();
  useEffect(() => {}, []);
  const callback = useCallback(() => {}, []);
  
  // 2. DERIVED VALUES AND LOGIC
  const derivedValue = state1 + state2;
  const handleClick = () => {};
  
  // 3. CONDITIONAL RETURNS (after all hooks)
  if (loading) return <Loading />;
  if (error) return <Error />;
  
  // 4. MAIN RENDER
  return <div>...</div>;
}
```

### Best Practices
1. **Never** put early returns before all hooks are called
2. **Always** call hooks at the top level of the component
3. **Use** ESLint plugin `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks` to catch violations
4. **Structure** components consistently: hooks ‚Üí logic ‚Üí conditionals ‚Üí render
5. **Test** components thoroughly in development mode

## ‚úÖ Status

**FIXED** ‚úÖ - React Hook Order violation completely resolved with proper hook sequencing and component structure.
