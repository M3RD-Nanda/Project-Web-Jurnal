# Crypto Wallet Dashboard - Compatibility Fixes

## Overview
This document outlines the compatibility fixes applied to the Crypto Wallet Dashboard to ensure full functionality and proper integration with the existing codebase.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Missing Solana Context Implementation
**Problem**: The `SolanaWalletButton` component referenced `useSolanaContext` which was not implemented.

**Solution**: 
- Added `useSolanaContext` hook to `SolanaProvider.tsx`
- Created proper context interface with network management and availability tracking
- Implemented context provider with proper state management

### 2. Duplicate SolanaProvider in Layout
**Problem**: `SolanaProvider` was wrapped twice in the layout hierarchy, causing potential conflicts.

**Solution**:
- Removed duplicate `SolanaProvider` wrapper from `layout.tsx`
- Kept the provider inside `Web3Provider` for proper integration

### 3. Missing Context Imports
**Problem**: Components were trying to use `useSolanaContext` without proper imports.

**Solution**:
- Updated `SolanaWalletButton.tsx` to import `useSolanaContext`
- Updated `useSolanaSafe.ts` to import the context hook
- Ensured all Solana-related components have proper imports

### 4. Context Type Safety
**Problem**: Missing TypeScript interfaces for Solana context.

**Solution**:
- Added `SolanaContextType` interface with proper typing
- Implemented network state management
- Added wallet state tracking in context

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/components/SolanaProvider.tsx`
- Added context creation and provider implementation
- Implemented `useSolanaContext` hook
- Added network state management
- Improved error handling for wallet operations

### 2. `src/app/layout.tsx`
- Removed duplicate `SolanaProvider` wrapper
- Simplified provider hierarchy

### 3. `src/components/wallet/SolanaWalletButton.tsx`
- Added missing `useSolanaContext` import
- Fixed context usage in component

### 4. `src/hooks/useSolanaSafe.ts`
- Added missing `useSolanaContext` import
- Ensured proper context integration
